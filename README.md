# Optimizing-Retail-Operations-via-Predictive-Sales-Analysis

**Abstract**

Sales forecasting remains a critical challenge for businesses due to the inherent volatility and complexity of market dynamics. Traditional sales forecasting methods often struggle to capture these intricate patterns, leading to suboptimal accuracy and ineffective decision-making. Statistical methods such as linear regression provide foundational insights but are limited in handling complex, non-linear relationships. This research addresses these limitations by exploring three distinct forecasting methodologies: statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The research evaluates the comparative performance of these techniques across the sales dataset of Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, highlighting their potential to improve forecasting accuracy and optimize sales strategies. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly the BiGRU model, outperform other models in performance.
